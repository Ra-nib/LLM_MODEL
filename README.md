# LLM_MODEL
The C++ Console Application with LLM Integration is a lightweight program that demonstrates how to use C++ to interact with a Large Language Model (LLM) API (such as OpenAI's GPT). This application serves as an example of leveraging AI to process user queries and generate intelligent responses in real time.The application demonstrates how to interact with an API using C++ libraries like cURL and JSON parsers.
# FeaturesAccepts user input through the console.
Sends the input to a configured LLM API (e.g., OpenAI GPT).
Receives and parses the API response.
Displays the AI-generated response in the console.
# Prerequisites
**1. Software Requirements:**
C++ compiler (GCC, Clang, or MSVC).
Optional: CMake for building the project.
**2. Dependencies:**
cURL library for HTTP requests.
JSON parser library (e.g., nlohmann/json).
**3. API Access:**
Obtain an API key from your LLM provider (e.g., OpenAI).
# Installation and Setup:  
**1. Clone the Repository**
git clone <repository_url>
cd <repository_name>
**2. Install Dependencies**
-Install cURL:
sudo apt-get install libcurl4-openssl-dev  # For Linux
brew install curl                         # For macOS
-Download the nlohmann JSON library:
wget https://github.com/nlohmann/json/releases/download/v3.11.2/json.hpp
**3. Configure API Key**
-Open the config.h file.
-Add your API key and API endpoint:
#define API_KEY "your_api_key_here"
#define API_URL "https://api.openai.com/v1/completions"
**4. Build the Application**
-Using g++:
g++ -o LLMApp main.cpp -lcurl
-Using CMake:
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
# How to Run:
1. Start the application:
./LLMApp
2. Enter your query when prompted.
3. Wait for the application to retrieve the AI-generated response.
4. View the response on the console.
5. Type exit to terminate the application.
# Application Workflow
1. User Input: The program accepts input from the user.
2. API Request: Sends an HTTP POST request to the LLM API with the userâ€™s query.
3. Response Parsing: Parses the JSON response received from the API.
4. Display Output: Shows the AI's response in the console.
# Known Issues
Slow responses due to network latency.
Limited API usage based on the provider's rate limits or token caps.
